# MC4.5
MC4.5 decision tree algorithm proposes an improved use of continuous attributes in C4.5 classifier. Here we present an implementation of MC4.5 algorithm under Weka-3.8 software.

## Installation:
The source code uploaded is designed to be integrated into the Weka software tool:(https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/)

In order to use the MC4.5 classifier, please download the Weka software tool and this repository. Notice that weka can be downloaded from the official repository (the version used of weka is 3.8). Then add all these files to the classpath:
